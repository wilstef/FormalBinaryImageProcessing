The Coq script formalizes the weighted round robin load
balancer alogirthm defined below. 

Supposing that there is a server set S = {S0, S1, â€¦, Sn-1};
W(Si) indicates the weight of Si;
i indicates the server selected last time, and i is initialized with -1;
cw is the current weight in scheduling, and cw is initialized with zero; 
max(S) is the maximum weight of all the servers in S;
gcd(S) is the greatest common divisor of all server weights in S;

(*A server with high weight gets more jobs. *)
Theorem high_weight_more_jobs: forall (s1 s2 jobs: nat) (S: Servers), 
  jobs > 0 -> 
  length S > 0 ->  (*if S is nil, schedule still returns 0::nil. Why?*)
  nth s1 S 0 > nth s2 S 0 -> 
  count_occ eqA_dec (schedule jobs S) s1 >= count_occ eqA_dec (schedule jobs S) s2.
